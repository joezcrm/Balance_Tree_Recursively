# Balance_Tree_Recursively
This is an implementation of a balance tree with all nodes having the same height being linked.  This project attempts to reuse the memory by storing the pointers to the created, but unused nodes.  This project is tested by sorting 50000 integers with the constant *NODE_SIZE* in the header file **balance_tree.h** being set to 32.  Each memory chunk used by the balance tree is set to 4 KB.  
A testing code is also added here to check the result.  The testing code is named matrix_calculations.cpp because I was preparing to implement certain matrix calculations methods, including solving a large system of linear equations, find the least quare for a matrix, and estimating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors and the singular value.
